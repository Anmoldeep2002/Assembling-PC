<h1>Assembling a PC</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this section, I'll demonstrate how I assemble a PC with another person. I will demonstrate each process in detail and provide screenshots with explanations for each computer component that I assemble.</p>


<br />

<h2>Step-by-Step Walk-Through:</h2>


<p align="center"> 
STEP 1 (ATTACHING CPU): <br/>

<p align="center">The first thing we did when we started assembling the computer was to install and attach the processor to the motherboard socket shown in the images above. To do so, we had to lift the lever and then place the processor below it. After that, we pressed the lever below it, allowing us to successfully install it.</p>

<p align="center">We installed the fan and heat sink above the processor and connected the fan's power cable. To install this component, all we had to do was pull the fan's black stands to the sides and then attach it to the motherboard, after which we plugged the necessary cable into the relevant fan socket.</p>

STEP 3 (ATTACHING MOTHERBOARD TO THE CASE): <br/>

<p align="center">We then proceeded to install and attach the motherboard to the case. To do this, we had to lift up the motherboard from the table and insert it in the proper location inside the computer case. Then, using the screwdriver, we placed the correct screws in the proper locations. After all that, we were able to attach it to the computer case.</p>

<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">Here, we plugged in the main USB and AUDIO cables required for the front ports to work. All we had to do to install them was put them inside the case, plug them into the proper sockets and names, and we were done.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 5 (INSTALLING RAM): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gieXXPC.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We then proceeded to install the previously removed RAM. All we had to do was bring the RAM to the precise slot shown in the image above and carefully press it in until we heard the small click that the white clips made.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 6 (INSERTING FLOPPY DISK DRIVE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gMK8ntz.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> </p>


<p align="center">Here, we inserted the floppy drive into the appropriate metal box that was fitted inside the case. All we had to do was insert the floppy drive into the metal box and then install the component from the sides using the screws and screwdriver.</p>


<hr width="100%" size="2">

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 7 (INSERTING OPTICAL DISK DRIVE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m7FBiPz.png" height="70%" width="70%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We proceeded to insert and install the previously removed optical drive. All we had to do was insert the optical drive from the outside of the case and gently slide it into the appropriate section. After that, we secured it from the side using the screwdriver.</p>


<hr width="100%" size="2">

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 8 (INSTALLING HARD DISK DRIVE): <br/>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/se8W6zj.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We moved on to installing the hard disk drive, which is one of the most crucial parts. The first thing we did was place it properly into the metal box shown in the first picture, then bring it inside the motherboard and secure it with the screwdriver and the required screws. After that, we connected the SATA cable from the hard drive to the motherboard.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 9 (CONNECTING OPTICAL DRIVE CABLES): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nj0kZXf.png" height="70%" width="70%"/> </p>


<p align="center">Here, we connected the optical drive's cables from the drive to the motherboard, using the IDE Connector. All we did was bring the cables inside and gently connect them into the appropriate sockets.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 10 (CONNECTING HARD DRIVE CABLES): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FKDia1X.png" height="70%" width="70%"/> </p>


<p align="center">Here, we connected and plugged the SATA cable from the hard drive to the motherboard. All we had to do was bring the red cable inside the case and carefully plug it into the appropriate socket.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 11 (INSTALLING POWER SUPPLY UNIT): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1t36STj.png" height="70%" width="70%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We proceeded to insert and install the power supply unit. All we had to do was place the supply unit into the case and secure it with the right screws using the screwdriver. After that, we had to connect the power connector for the supply unit to the motherboard, as seen in the second picture.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 12 (CONNECTING OPTICAL DRIVE POWER CABLE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kiH5LRF.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> </p>


<p align="center">Here, we connected the optical drive's power cable directly to the power supply unit. We did not have to connect it to the motherboard, but rather to the supply unit. Without this cable, the indicated component would not function. All we had to do was carefully attach it to the correct socket.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 13 (CONNECTING HARD DRIVE POWER CABLE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q8gsQHl.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> </p>


<p align="center">Here, we connected the power cable from the supply unit directly to the hard disc drive, as shown in the image above. All we had to do was gently insert the power connector into the correct socket.</p>


<hr width="100%" size="2">

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 14 (CONNECTING FLOPPY DISK POWER CABLE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ioZj2sh.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We then connected the last remaining cable, which was the floppy drive's power cable. Once again, the cable came from the supply unit, and all we had to do was carefully attach it to the correct socket shown in the picture above.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 15 (CLOSING COMPUTER SIDE CASE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0hMIBqZ.png" height="75%" width="75%"/> </p>


<p align="center">This was the final step, and all we needed to do was close the case from the side, as shown in the second picture. On the first image, you can see that we were successful in building a computer, with all of the components and wires properly installed. To close the case, all we had to do was slide it and secure it with proper screws from the back using the screwdriver.</p>
